# Privacy Policy

## Platinum Privacy Policy

The only personal information we collect is your [repl.it](https://repl.it) username and project name if you provide it to us to setup the uptime checks module.

We use it to form a [repl.it](https://repl.it) project url to send HTTP Requests to. This lets us provide our uptime check service. It is not shared with anyone besides the bot code itself and the bot developers if they need it to provide a service. We use the hosting company [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) to store the bot data.

You can remove your [repl.it](https://repl.it) username and project name from our database by sending `@Platinum#1240 remove-uptime-checks-data` on the server that the uptime check data is linked to or you can contact a Developer on the [official support server](https://lengo.dev/platinum/support).

If you have any questions about the data we collect, you may contact a Developer on the [official support server](https://lengo.dev/platinum/support).
